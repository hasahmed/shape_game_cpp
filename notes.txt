Currently trying to move objects. I've figured out the open gl stuff to make it
happen, now I just need to integrate it with the rest of the code


this is the code needed to make it happen

GLCALL(glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, renderPack->glRenderObject->vbo));
renderPack->glRenderObject->verts[0] += 0.02;
GLCALL(
		glBufferSubData(
				GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,
				0,
					sizeof(float),
				&(renderPack->glRenderObject->verts)[0]
				// GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW
		)
);
quick and dirty implemented code it takes to move things. Now need an update update call
running into problems with the runtime polymorphism. Dynamic cast returing null for some reason
