    3D coordinates that should form a triangle. These coordinates are in an
    array called Vertex Data.
    This vertex data is a collection of verticies, and here a vertex means
    a collection of data per 3D coordinate. This data is reprsented using
    VERTEX ATTRIBUTES that can contain any data, but for now were going to assume its
    just a 3D position, and a color

In OpenGL we bind the handle to a target name and then execute commands on that target
